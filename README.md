# Project 4

Learning a new language? What better way to practice than to chat live with fluent speakers? Meet Chatter (WIP), a quick way to connect with fluent speakers through text. Learning a new language is hard, and learning how to speak conversationally can be even harder. Practice and hone your skills with Chatter and make new connections along the way.
